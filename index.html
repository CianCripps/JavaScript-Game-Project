        <h1>Welcome to Kenny's Farm</h1>
        <p>
            In Kenny's Farm you play as a simple farm man, Kenny Mcdonald.
            Despite this his farm proves to be far from simple. Kenny has locked himself out of his barn
            to be surprised by ghosts haunting him. Try and collect as many keys as you can before a ghost catches you!
        </p>
        <p>
            Be sure to check everywhere in the farm for keys!
        </p>
